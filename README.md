# Temple-X
Hey there. This is Temple X aka Reworked Temple for Synapse X, Requested by R3koved and some people that also wants it but didn't request it.

I do not recommend doing stuff with source code if you aren't a software developer or you don't know the programming language it uses (C#).

The purpose of source code is to teach people that temple x is not a virus, you are allowed to study the source code or fork it but not sell it and thats why there's a license. Anyway let's get into the installation.

If you're on window 10 please install webview2 unless you're on windows 11.

Installion Steps:
1. Download latest version (highly recommended) from Releases Tab
2. Extract the zip with winrar or 7z.
3. Move everything in the extracted folder into synapse x folder. Please note you must have synapse x for this to work. If you do not have it then buy it at x.synapse.to in your browser.
4. Now run the exe and enjoy ;)
